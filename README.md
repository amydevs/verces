# Verces
A WIP server implementation of the ActivityPub protocol and Mastodon CRUD API.

## What is this?
ActivityPub is a protocol for the intercommunication of servers in sharing information. It is generally used by social media platforms like Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Peertube.
Verces is a lightweight server implementation of the protocol so the low costs of serverless functions on services such as Vercel/Cloudflare can be utilized to create a federated social media platform that is more accessible to self-host.
